## **About the app**
This app will provide real-time chatting and media streaming via video call feature


## **Setup**
Its good practice to create virtual environment before initializing the project to isolate project environment with our working enviroment

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Now we are good to go to start our frontend and backend

To start frontend on local (make sure you are on root directory of project)
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

To start backend on local (make sure you are on root directory of project)
```bash
cd backend
python3 main.py
```
